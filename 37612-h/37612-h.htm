<p class="p2">To face page iv</p>
<p class="p2">Since the first of August, 1914, this
prophecy of Nietzsche's
has shaped itself in the author's mind in an altered tense and in an
altered mood.&#8212;The time HAS come when men MUST think of nothing but
education; by education the author does not mean inconsequential
bookishness, and neither did Nietzsche!</p>
<hr />
<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg_v]</a></span>
<p>The greater part and first essay, entitled <i>Bill's
School and Mine</i>, was written in 1903, but the title and some
of the material were borrowed from my friend and college mate William
Allen White in 1912, when the essay was printed in the South Bethlehem
<i>Globe</i> to stimulate interest in a local Playground
Movement.</p>
<p>The second essay,&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">The
Study of Science,</span> is taken from Franklin and
MacNutt's&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Elements
of Mechanics,</span> The Macmillan Company, New York, 1908. I
have no illusions concerning the mathematical sciences, for it is to
such that the essay chiefly relates. Unquestionably the most important
function of education is to develop personality and character; but
science is impersonal, and an essay which attempts to set forth the
meaning of science study must make an unusual demand upon the reader.
Some things in this world are to be understood by sympathy, and some
things are to be understood by serious and painful effort.<br />
<br />
The third essay,&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Part
of an Education,</span> was privately printed in 1903 under the
title&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">A Tramp
Trip in the Rockies,</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg_vi]</a></span>
and it is introduced here to
illustrate a phase of real education which is in danger of becoming
obsolete. The school of hardship is not for those who love luxury, and
to the poverty stricken it is not a school--it is a Juggernaut.<br />
<br />
The five minor essays are mere splashes, as it were; but in each I have
said everything that need be said, except perhaps in the matter of
exhortation.<br />
<br />
For the illustrations I am under obligations to my cousin Mr. Daniel
Garber of Philadelphia.</p>

<h2>SUPPLEMENT TO PREFACE.</h2>
<p> Your attention is called especially to the five short essays,
or splashes,
on pages&nbsp;<a href="#Page_25">25</a>,&nbsp;<a href="#Page_29">29</a>,&nbsp;<a href="#Page_58">58</a>,&nbsp;<a href="#Page_91">91</a>
and&nbsp;<a href="#Page_95">95</a>;
each of these short
essays fills about a page, and if you read them
you will understand why the
<i>Independent</i> has called this little book A Package of
Dynamite.</p>
<p>The first essay, entitled <span class="smcap">Bill's
School and Mine</span>, is easy reading, and if one is not
irredeemably literal in
one's mode of thinking, it is very pleasant reading. The tall talk
which is sprinkled&nbsp;throughout this essay and which reaches a
climax on
pages&nbsp;<a href="#Page_19">19</a>
and&nbsp;<a href="#Page_20">20</a>&nbsp; is
not intended to be actually fatal in its seemingly
murderous quality! Many contented city people in reading this essay
should be
prompted after the manner of a cow-boy who in a spell of seemingly
careless gun play says to his sophisticated friend "Smile, D&#8212;&#8212; You,
Smile".</p>
<p>The essay on The Study of
Science, is somewhat of a "sticker", and if any particular reader does
not
like it he can let it alone, but there is an increasing number of
young men in this world who must study science whether they like
it or not. Indeed the object of this particular essay is to explain
this remarkable and in some respects distressing fact. The essay
relates primarily to the physical sciences, narrowly speaking, because
the author's teaching experience has been wholly in physics and
chemistry. One can get a fairly good idea of the author's point of view
by reading the portions of the essay which stand in large print, but it
is quite necessary to read the small print with more or less painful
care if one is to get any fundamental idea of the matter under
consideration.
The reader will please consider thoughtfully the close juxtaposition
of this essay and the following short essay on The Discipline
of Work.</p>
<p class="p1">The third essay, <i>Part of an
Education</i>, is the story of
a tramp trip
through the Rocky Mountains of Colorado and Wyoming, and it is an
introduction to the little essay on The Uses of Hardship.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I always think of my school as my boyhood. <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg_3]</a></span>
Until I was big enough to swim the
Missouri River my home was in a little Kansas town, and we boys lived
in the woods and in the water all Summer, and in the woods and on the
ice all Winter. We trapped and hunted, we rowed and fished,and built
dams, and cut stick horses, and kept stick-horse livery stables
where the grapevines hung, and where the paw-paws mellowed in the
Fall. We made mud slides into our swimming hole, and we were artists in
mud-tattoo, painting face and body with thin black mud and scraping
white stripes from head to foot. We climbed the trees and cut our
names, we sucked the sap of the box elder and squashed poke berries
for war paint. We picked wild grapes and gooseberries, and made
pop-guns to shoot green haws. In the Autumn we gathered walnuts, and in
the Spring we greeted the johnny-jump-ups, and the sweet williams
as they peered through the mold.
</p>
<p>Always, we boys were out of doors, as it seems to me; and I
did the chores. It
is something to learn the toughness of hickory under the saw, how
easily walnut splits, how mean elm is to <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg_4]</a></span>
handle: and a certain dexterity
comes to a boy who teaches a calf to drink, or slops hogs without
soiling his Sunday clothes in the evening. And the hay makes acrobats.
In the loft a boy learns to turn flip-flops, and with a lariat
rope he can make a trapeze. My rings were made by padding the iron
rings from the hubs of a lumber wagon and swinging them from the
rafters.</p>
<p>Bill, little Bethlehem Bill, has a better school than I had;
the
house and the things that go with it. Bill's teachers know more
accurately what they
are about than did my teachers in the old days out West half a century
ago. And, of course, Bill is getting things from his school that I did
not get. But he is growing up with a woefully distorted idea of life.
What does Bill know about the woods and the flowers? Where in
Bill's makeup is that which comes from browsing on berries and nuts
and the rank paw paw, and roaming the woods like the Bander-log?
And the crops, what does he know about them?
</p>
<p>The silver-sides used to live in the pool under the limestone
ledges by the old
stone quarry where the snakes would sun themselves at noon. The wild
rose, with its cinnamon-scented flower and curling leaves, used to
bloom in May for <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg_5]</a>
</span> me&#8212;for me and a
little brown-eyed girl who found her
ink-bottle filled with them when the school bell called us in from
play. And on Saturdays we boys roamed over the prairies picking wild
flowers, playing wild plays and dreaming wild dreams&#8212;children's dreams.
Do
you suppose that little Bill dreams such dreams in a fifty-foot
lot with only his mother's flowers in the window pots to teach him
the great mystery of life?</p>
<p>Bill has no barn. I doubt if he can skin a cat, and I am sure
he cannot do
the big drop from the trapeze. To turn a flip-flop would fill him
with alarm, and yet Jim Betts, out in Kansas, used to turn a double
flip-flop over a stack of barrels! And Jim Betts is a man to look at.
He is built by the day. He has an educated body, and it is going into
its fifties with health and strength that Bill will have to work
for. And Jim Betts and I used to make our own kites and nigger-shooters
and sleds and rabbit traps.
</p>
<p> Bill's school seems real enough, but his play and his work
seem rather empty. Of
course Bill cannot have the fringe of a million square miles of wild
buffalo range for his out-of-doors. No, Bill cannot have that. Never,
again. And to imagine that Bill needs anything of the kind is to <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg_6]</a></span>
forget
the magic of Bill's "make-believe!" A tree, a brook, a stretch of
grass!
What old-world things Bill's fancy can create there! What untold
history repeat itself in Bill's most fragmentary play! Bill, is by
nature, a conjuror. Give him but little and he will make a world for
himself, and grow to be a man. Older people seem, however, to forget,
and deprive Bill of the little that he needs; and it is worth while,
therefore, to develop the contrast between Bill's school and that
school of mine in the long-ago land of my boyhood out-of-doors.
</p>
<p> The Land of Out-of-Doors! What irony there is in such glowing
phrase to city
boys like Bill! The supreme delight of my own boyhood days was to
gather
wild flowers in a wooded hollow, to reach which led across a sunny
stretch of wild meadow rising to the sky; and I would have you know
that I lived as a boy in a land where a weed never grew.
<a id="FNanchor_1" name="FNanchor_1"></a><a class="fnanchor" href="#footnote_1">[1]</a> I
wish that Bill <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg_7]</a>
</span>might have access
to the places where the wild flowers grow, and
above all I wish that Bill might have more opportunity to see his
father at work. A hundred years ago these things were within the reach
of every boy and girl; but now, alas, Bill sees no other manual labor
than
the digging of a ditch in a cluttered street, or stunted in growth, he
has almost become a part of the machine he daily tends, and Boyville
has become a paved and guttered city, high-walled, desolate, and dirty;
with here and there a vacant lot hideous with refuse in early Spring
and overwhelmed with an increasing pestilence of weeds as the Summer
days go by! And the strangest thing about it all is, that Bill accepts
unquestioningly, and even with manifestations of joy, just any sort of
a world, if only it is flooded with sunshine.
</p>
<p> I remember how, in my boyhood, the rare advent of an old tin
can in my favorite swimming hole used to offend me, while such a thing
as a cast-off shoe was simply intolerable, and I <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg_8]</a></span>wonder
that Bill's unquenchable
delight in outdoor life does not become an absolute rage in his
indifference to the dreadful pollution of the streams and the universal
pestilence of weeds and refuse in our thickly populated districts.</p>
<p> I cannot refrain from quoting an amusing poem of James
Whitcomb Riley's,
which expresses (more completely than anything I know) the delight of
boys in outdoor life, where so many things happen and so many
things lure; and you can easily catch in the swing of Riley's verse
that
wanton note which is ordinarily so fascinatingly boyish, but which
may too easily turn to a raging indifference to everything that makes
for purity in this troubled life of ours.

and this kind of hunting is better than the kind that needs
a gun. To one who falls into the habit of it, the gun is indeed a
useless tool.
I am reminded of a day I spent with a gun at a remote place in the
Rocky
Mountains, where, during the 25 days I have camped there on four
different trips, I have seen as many as 150 of the wildest of North
American animals, the Rocky Mountain sheep. I lay in ambush for three
hours waiting for sheep, and the sheep came; but they were out of range
again before I saw them because I had become so interested in killing
mosquitoes! I timed myself at intervals, and 80 per minute for three
solid hours makes an honest estimate of 14,400. And I was hungry,
too. I fancy the sheep were not frightened but wished the good work to
go on undisturbed.

<p>Do you, perhaps, like candy? Did you ever consider that the
only sweetmeat
our forefathers had for thousands of years was wild honey? And those
sour times&#8212;if I may call them such&#8212;before the days of sugar and
candy, come much nearer to us than you realize, for I can remember
my own grandfather's tales of bee-hunting in Tennessee. Just imagine
how exciting it must have been in the days of long-ago to find a tree
loaded with&#8212;candy! A bee tree! If Bill were to go back with me to the
wild <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg_12]</a>
</span> woods of
Tennessee, some thrill of that old excitement would well
up from the depths of his soul at finding such a tree. You may wonder
what I am driving at, so I will tell you, that one of the most exciting
experiences of my boyhood was a battle with a colony of bumble
bees. I was led into it by an older companion and the ardor and
excitement of that battle, as I even now remember it, are wholly
inexplicable
to me except I think of it as a representation through inherited
instinct of a ten-thousand-years' search for wild honey.</p>
<p>My schooling grew out of instinctive reactions toward natural
things; hunting
and fishing, digging and planting in the Spring, nutting in the Fall,
and the thousands of variations which these things involve, and I
believe that the play of instinct is the only solid basis of growth of
a boy or girl. I believe, furthermore, that the very essence of
boy humor is bound up with the amazing incongruity of his instincts.
Was there ever a boy whose instincts (many of them mere fatuity
like his digestive appendix) have not led him time and again into just
thin air, to say nothing of water and mud! For my part I have never
known anything more supremely funny than learning what a hopeless
mess of wood pulp and <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg_13]</a></span>
worms a bumble-bee's nest really is, except,
perhaps, seeing another boy learn the same stinging lesson.
</p>
<p> The use of formulas, too, is unquestionably instinctive, and
we all know how
apt a boy is to indulge in formulas of the hocus-pocus sort, like Tom
Sawyer's recipe for removing warts by the combined charm of black
midnight and a black cat, dead. And a boy arrives only late in his
boyhood, if ever, to some sense of the distinction between formulas
of this kind and such as are vital and rational. I think that there is
much instruction and a great deal of humor connected with the play of
this instinctive tendency. I remember a great big boy, a hired man on
my grandfather's farm, in fact, who was led into a fight with a nest of
hornets with the expectation that he would bear a charmed skin if he
shouted in loud repetition the words, "Jew's-harp, jew's-harp."
</p>
<p>Talk about catching birds by putting salt on their tails!
Once, as I rowed
around a bend on a small stream, I saw a sand-hill crane stalking
along the shore. Into the water I went with the suddenly conceived
idea that I could catch that crane, and, swimming low, I reached
the shore, about 20 feet from the bird, jumped quickly out <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg_14]</a></span>
of the
water, made a sudden dash and the bird was captured! Once I saw a
catfish, gasping for air at the surface of water that had been muddied
by the opening of a sluice-way in a dam. Swimming up behind the fish,
I jambed a hand into each gill, and, helped by the fish's tail, I
pushed it ashore; and it weighed 36 pounds! A friend of mine, by the
name of Stebbins, once followed his dog in a chase after a jack rabbit.
The rabbit made a wide circle and came back to its own trail some
distance ahead of the dog, then it made a big sidewise jump, and sat
looking at the dog as it passed by; so intently indeed that Stebbins
walked up behind the rabbit and took it up with his hands.</p>
<p>I think you will agree with me that my outdoor school was a
wonderful thing. The
Land of Out-of-Doors! To young people the best school and play-house,
and to older people an endless asylum of delight.

<p class="p2">The most important thing, I should say, for
the success of Bill's fine school is that ample opportunity be given to
Bill for every variety of play
including swimming and skating, and wherever possible, boating. It is
ridiculous to attempt to teach Bill anything without the substantial
results of play to build upon. Playgrounds are the cheapest
and, in many respects, the best of schools, but they are almost
entirely lacking in many of our towns which have grown to cities in
a generation in this great nation of villagers. The Boroughs of the
Bethlehems, for example, have no playground connected with <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg_16]</a></span>
a Public
School, nor any other public place where boys can play ball.
</p>
<br />
<p class="title">WHAT DO YOU THINK?</p>
<p class="p2">(This and
the following communication are from a small paper, printed
and published by two Bethlehem boys.)</p>
<p class="p2">We, the editors, have been dragged along
back
alleys, across open
sewers, and through rank growths of weed and thistle to view the
Monocacy meadows to consider the possibility of their use as a
playground or park. We are not much impressed with the
proposal, the place is apparently hopeless, but the park enthusiast
could not be touched by argument. To our very practical
objection that the cost would be excessive, he made the
foolish reply that there is no cost but a saving in using what has
hitherto been wasted. To our expressed disgust for the open
sewers and filth he replied that that was beside the question,
for, as he said, we must sooner or later take care of the
filth anyway. But, we said, the creek is contaminated above the
town. Very well, he replied, we have the right to
prohibit such contamination. But worst of all, in double meaning,
was his instant agreement to our statement that we had our
cemeteries which, he said, were really better than any Bethlehem
park could be.</p>
<br />
<p class="title">COMMUNICATION.</p>
<p class="p2"><i>Dear Editors</i>: I took a
walk
along the Monocacy Creek on Sunday
afternoon and discovered clear water several miles above
town and a fine skating pond; but I suppose that you and all of
your subscribers will have to go to our enterprising neighbor,
Allentown, to find any well-kept ice to skate on <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg_17]</a></span>
this
Winter. Most people think that you boys can swim in Nature's
own water, skate on Nature's own ice, and roam in Nature's
own woods, but it is absolutely certain that your elders
must take some care and pains if you town boys are to do any of
these things. And yet, here in the East, children are said
to be brought up (implying care and pains) and hogs are said
to be raised (implying only feeding). I thank the Lord that
I was "raised" in the West where there are no such false
distinctions.<span class="floatright">Your subscriber, S.</span></p>
<p class="p2">P.S.&#8212;As I came home covered with beggar-lice
and cockle-burrs I saw a ring of fire on South Mountain, an annual
occurrence which has been delayed a whole week this Autumn by a
flourish of
posters in several languages offering One Hundred Dollars Reward!
<span class="floatright">S.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> In these days of steam and electricity we
boast
of having conquered nature.
Well, we have got to domesticate nature before much else can be
accomplished in this country of ours. We have got to take care of our
brooks
and our rivers, of our open lands and our wooded hills. We have got
to do it, and Bill would be better off if we took half of the cost of
his fine school to meet the expense of doing it. When I was aboy I
belonged to the Bander-log, but Bill belongs to another tribe, the
Rats,
and there is nothing I would like so much to do as to turn Pied Piper
and lure the entire brood of Bethlehem boys <span class="pagenum">

and
into that awful chasm of crystal water to come back no
more, no, not even when an awakened civic consciousness had made a
park of the beautiful Monocacy meadows and converted the creek into a
chain, a regular Diamond Necklace of swimming holes. I beg the garbage
men's (not a printer's error for man's) pardon for speaking of the
beautiful Monocacy meadows. I refer to what has been and to what might
easily continue to be. As for the Diamond Necklace, that, of course,
would have to be above our gas works where the small stream of pure
tar now joins the main stream.</p>
<p>I know a small river in Kansas which is bordered by rich
bottom lands from
one-half to one mile in width between beautifully scalloped
bluffs&#8212;where
the upland prairie ends. In early days thick covering of grass was
everywhere, and the clear stream, teeming with life, wound its way
along a deep channel among scattered clusters of large walnut trees and
dense groves of elm and cotton wood, rippling here and there over beds
of rock. Now, however, every foot of ground, high and low, is
mellowed by the plow, and the last time I saw the once beautiful valley
of
Wolf River it was as if the whole earth <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg_19]</a>
</span> had melted with the rains of
June, such devastation of mud was there! Surely it requires more than
the plow to domesticate nature; indeed, since I have lived between
the coal-bearing Alleghenies and the sea, I have come to believe that
it
may require more than the plow and the crowded iron furnace, such
pestilence
of refuse and filth is here!</p>
<p>I suppose that I am as familiar with the requirements of
modern industry
as any man living, and as ready to tolerate everything that is
economically wise, but every day as I walk to and fro I see our
Monocacy
Creek covered with a scum of tar, and in crossing the river bridge I
see a half mile long heap of rotting refuse serving the Lehigh as
a bank on the southern side; not all furnace refuse either by any
means, but nameless stinking stuff cast off by an indifferent
population
and carelessly left in its very midst in one long unprecedented
panorama of putrescent ugliness! And when, on splendid Autumn
days, the nearby slopes of old South Mountain lift the eyes into pure
oblivion of these distressing things, I see again and again a line of
fire sweeping through the scanty woods. This I have seen every
Autumn since first I came to Bethlehem.</p>
<p>It is easy to speak in amusing hyperbole of <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg_20]</a>
</span> garbage heaps and of brooks
befouled with tar, but to have seen one useless flourish of posters
on South Mountain in fifteen years! That is beyond any possible
touch of humor. It is indeed unfortunate that our river is not fit
for boys to swim in, and it is not, for I have tried it, and I am not
fastidious either, having lived an amphibious boyhood on the banks
of the muddiest river in the world; but it is a positive disgrace
that our river is not fit to look at, that it is good for nothing
whatever but to drink; much too good, one would think, for people who
protect the only stretch of woodland that is accessible to their boys
and girls by a mere flourish of posters! I was born in Kansas when
its inhabitants were largely Indians, and when
its greatest resource was wild buffalo skins; and whatever objection
you may have to this description of my present home-place between
the coal-bearing Alleghenies and the sea, please do not imagine
that I have a sophisticated sentimentality towards the Beauties
of Nature! No, I am still enough of an Indian to think chiefly of
my belly when I look at a stretch of country. In the West I like the
suggestion of hog-and-hominy which spreads for miles and miles
beneath the sky, and here in the East I like the promise of pillars of
fire and smoke and I like the song of steam!</p>

<p>Bill's School and Mine! It may seem that I have said a great
deal about my
school, and very little about Bill's. But what is Bill's school?
Surely, Bill's fine school-house and splendid teachers, and Bill's
good mother are not all there is to Bill's school. No, Bill's school is
as big as all Bethlehem, and in its bigger aspects it is a bad
school, bad because Bill has no opportunity to play as a boy should
play, and bad because Bill has no opportunity to work as a boy should
work.</p>

Every one knows that play means health and happiness to children, and
nearly every one thinks of the playgrounds movement as based solely<br />
on ideals of health and ideals of happiness in a rather narrow sense;
but the movement means much more than health and happiness as these
terms are generally understood.<br />
<br />
The Indian boy's play, which included practice with the bow and arrow,
foot racing, ball playing and horse-back riding, was perfectly adapted
to the needs of his adult life, but how about base ball and prisoner's

or an engineer? Good fun and a good appetite certainly come from these
games, and one may also place to their credit a tempered reasonableness

<br />
Play as a training in application! That certainly is a paradox; and yet
everyone knows that play is the first thing in life to give rise to
that peculiar overwhelming eagerness which alone can bring every atom
of one's strength into action. Ability to focus one's whole mind upon
an undertaking and to apply one's whole body in concentrated effort is
what our boys and girls are most in need of, and vigorous competitive
play serves better than anything else, if, indeed there is anything
else to create it.<br />
<br />
Intense and eager application! That means not only an escape from
laziness and apathy, but eagerness is the only thing in the world that
&nbsp;defies fatigue. A healthy boy can put forth an amazing amount
of physical effort and be fresh at the end of a day of play. And a man
whose habit of application is so highly developed that it assumes a

<p class="p2">The lure of the wild! Alas it is but a

perennial race of Wild Indians however tame the world may come to be;
and fortunately they are not dependent upon completely truthful

an out-of-doors, never again as long as the earth shall last. Indeed he
has no need of such a thing, for if his fancy is stirred by ardent

persistent, single-minded and strenuous activity.<br />

Many grown-ups seem to think that mere permission is now a sufficient
basis for play, as it was in pioneer and rural days. Indeed this is
largely true for very small children who can sit in the sunshine and
make mud pies or dig holes in a bed of sand; but with older boys it is
different. They may indeed fight or steal, or engage in the worst
varieties of gang activity, or sit by a fire in a back alley talking
sex like grown-up sordidly imaginative Hottentots in Darkest Africa;
but strenuous play requires suggestive example and organization, as
with our Boy Scouts; and it depends to a very great extent upon
competitive athletics. A dozen large ball fields and two or three

in one way this constraint is more and more relieved with the progress
of the applied sciences, in another way it becomes more and more
exacting. It is indeed easier to cross the Atlantic Ocean now than it
was in Leif Ericsson's time, but consider the discipline of the shop,
and above all consider the rules of machine design! Could even the
hardy Norsemen have known anything as uncompromisingly exacting
as these? To do things becomes easier and easier, but to learn how
to do things becomes more and more difficult.</p>
<p> Every person I have ever talked with, old or young, theorist
or practician,
student-in-general or specialist in whatever line, has exhibited
more or less distinctly a certain attitude of impatience towards
the exactions of this or that phase of the precise modes of thought of
the physical sciences.</p>

</span>In a recent article<a id="FNanchor_4" name="FNanchor_4"></a>
<a class="fnanchor" href="#footnote_4">[4]</a>
on
the distinction between the liberal and technical
in education, my friend and colleague, Professor Percy Hughes,
says that in speaking of an education as liberal we thereby associate
it with liberalism in politics, in philosophy and theology, and in
men's personal relations with each other. In each case liberalism
seems fundamentally, to denote freedom, and liberalism in education
is the freedom of development in each individual of that character
and personality which is his true nature. All this I accept in the
spirit of an optimist, assuming men's true natures to be good, but I do
not, and I am sure that Professor Hughes does not, consider that
technical education, unless it be inexcusably harsh and narrow, is
illiberal; nor that liberal education, unless it be inexcusably soft
and
vague, is wholly non-technical. The liberal and the technical are not
two kinds of education, each complete in itself. Indeed, Professor
Hughes speaks of liberal education, not as a category, but as a
condition which makes for freedom of development of personality and
character.</p>
<p>It seems to me, however, that there are phases of education
which have but little to do with <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg_35]</a>
</span> personality, and I call to your attention this definition
of liberalism in education, in order that I may turn sharply away from
it as a partial definition which, to a great extent, excludes the
physical sciences. Indeed, I wish to speak of a condition in education
which is
the antithesis of freedom. I wish to explain the teaching of elementary
physical science as a mode of constraint, as an impressed constructive
discipline without which no freedom is possible in our dealings
with physical things. I wish to characterize the study of elementary
physical science as a reorganization of the workaday mind of a young
man as complete as the pupation of an insect; and I wish to
emphasize the necessity of exacting constraint as the essential
condition
of this reorganization.</p>
<p> There is a kind of salamander, the axolotl, which lives a
tadpole-like youth and
never changes to the adult form unless a stress of dry weather
annihilates his watery world; but he lives always and reproduces
his kind as a tadpole, and a very funny-looking tadpole he is, with
his lungs hanging like feathery tassels from the sides of his head.
When the aquatic home of the axolotl dries up, he quickly develops a
pair of internal lungs, lops off his tassels and <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg_36]</a>
</span>embarks on a new mode
of life on land. So it is with our young men who are to develop beyond
the
tadpole stage, they must meet with quick and responsive inward growth
that new and increasing "stress of dryness," as many are wont to call
our
modern age of science and organized industry.</p>
<p> Stress of dryness! Indeed no flow of humor is to be found in
the detached
impersonalities of the sciences, and if we are to understand the
characteristics of physical science we must turn our attention to
things
which lead inevitably to an exacting and rigid mathematical philosophy.
It certainly is presumptive to tell a reader that he must turn his
attention to such a thing, but there is no other way; the best we
can do is to choose the simplest path. Let us therefore consider
the familiar phenomena of motion.</p>
<p>The most prominent aspect of all phenomena is motion. In that
realm of nature
which is not of man's devising<a id="FNanchor_5" name="FNanchor_5"></a>
<a class="fnanchor" href="#footnote_5">[5]</a>
motion is universal. In the <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg_37]</a>
</span> other realm of nature, the realm of things devised,
motion is no less prominent.
Every purpose of our practical life is accomplished by
movements of the body and by directed movements of tools and
mechanisms,
such as the swing of scythe and flail, and the studied movements
of planer and lathe from which are evolved the strong-armed steam
shovel and the deft-fingered loom.</p>
<p>The laws of motion. Every one has a sense of the absurdity of
the idea of
reducing the more complicated phenomena of nature to an orderly system
of
mechanical law. To speak of motion is to call to mind first of
all the phenomena that are associated with the excessively complicated,
incessantly changing, turbulent and tumbling motion of wind and
water. These phenomena have always had the most insistent appeal to
us, they have confronted us everywhere and always, and life is an
unending contest with their fortuitous diversity, which rises only too
often to irresistible sweeps of destruction in fire and flood, and
in irresistible crash of collision and collapse where all things
mingle in one dread fluid confusion! The laws of motion! Consider
the awful complexity of a disastrous tornado or the dreadful confusion
of a railway <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg_38]</a>
</span> wreck, and understand that what we call the laws of
motion, although they have a great deal to do with the ways in which we
think, have very little to do with the phenomena of nature. The laws of
motion! There is indeed a touch of arrogance in such a phrase with its
unwarranted suggestion of completeness and universality, and yet the
ideas which constitute the laws of motion have an almost unlimited
extent of
legitimate range, <i>and these ideas must be possessed with a
perfect
precision if one is to acquire any solid knowledge whatever of the
phenomena of motion</i>. The necessity of precise ideas. Herein
lies the
impossibility of compromise and the necessity of coercion and
constraint;
one must think so and so, there is no other way. And yet there
is always a conflict in the mind of even the most willing student
because of the constraint which precise ideas place upon our vivid and
primitively adequate sense of physical things; and this conflict
is perennial but it is by no means a one-sided conflict between
mere crudity and refinement, for refinement ignores many things.
Indeed, precise ideas not only help to form
<a id="FNanchor_6" name="FNanchor_6"></a><a class="fnanchor" href="#footnote_6">[6]</a> our
sense of the world
in which we live but they inhibit sense as well, and their rigid and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg_39]</a>
</span> unchallenged rule would be indeed a stress of dryness.</p>
<p>The laws of motion. We return again and yet again to the
subject, for one is not
to be deterred therefrom by any concession of inadequacy, no, nor by
any degree of respect for the vivid youthful sense of those things
which to suit our narrow purpose must be stripped completely bare. It
is unfortunate, however, that the most familiar type of motion,
the flowing of water or the blowing of the wind, is bewilderingly
useless as a basis for the establishment of the simple and
precise ideas which are called the "laws of motion," and which are the
most important of the fundamental principles of physics. These ideas
have
in fact grown out of the study of the simple phenomena which are
associated with the motion of bodies in bulk without perceptible
change of form, the motion of rigid bodies, so called.</p>
<p>Before narrowing down the scope of the discussion, however,
let us illustrate
a very general application of the simplest idea of motion, the idea
of velocity. Every one has, no doubt, an idea of what is meant by
the velocity of the wind; and a sailor, having what he calls a ten-knot
wind, knows that he can manage his boat with a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg_40]</a>
</span> certain spread of canvas
and that he can accomplish a certain portion of his voyage in a given
time; but an experienced sailor, although he speaks glibly of a
ten-knot wind, belies his speech by taking wise precaution against
every
conceivable emergency. He knows that a ten-knot wind is by no means a
sure or a simple thing with its incessant blasts and whirls; and a
sensitive anemometer, having more regard for minutiae than any sailor,
usually
registers in every wind a number of almost complete but excessively
irregular stops and starts every minute and variations of direction
that sweep around half the horizon!</p>

</p>
<p class="add5em smcap nospace">Goethe</p>
<p class="p5">We must evidently direct our attention to
something simpler than the wind.
Let us, therefore, consider the drawing of a wagon or the propulsion
of a boat. It is a familiar experience that effort is required
to start a body moving and that continued effort is required to
maintain the motion. Certain very simple facts as to the nature and
effects of
this effort were discovered <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg_41]</a>
</span> by Sir Isaac Newton, and on the basis of
these facts Newton formulated the laws of motion.</p>
<p class="add2em">The effort required to start a body
or to keep it moving is called
force. Thus, if one starts a box sliding along a table one is
said to exert a force on the box. The same effect might be
accomplished by interposing a stick between the hand and the box,
in which case one would exert a force on the stick and the
stick in its turn would exert a force on the box. We thus
arrive at the notion of force action between inanimate bodies,
between the stick and the box in this case, and Newton pointed
out that the force action between the two bodies
<i>A</i> and <i>B</i> always consists of two
equal and
opposite forces, that is to say, if body <i>A</i> exerts a
force on
<i>B</i>, then <i>B</i> exerts an equal
and opposite force on <i>A</i>, or, to use Newton's words,
action is
equal to reaction and in a contrary direction.</p>
<p>In leading up to this statement one might consider the force
with which a person pushes on the box and the equal and opposite force
with which the
box pushes back on the person, but if one does not wish to introduce
the stick as an intermediary, it is better to speak of the force
with which the hand pushes on the box, and the equal and opposite
force with which the box pushes back on the hand, because in discussing
physical phenomena it is of the utmost importance to pay attention
only to impersonal <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg_42]</a>
</span>[42] things. Indeed our modern industrial life, in
bringing men face to face with an entirely unprecedented array of
intricate mechanical and physical problems, demands of every one a
great and increasing amount of impersonal thinking, and the precise
and rigorous modes of thought of the physical sciences are being
forced upon widening circles of men with a relentless insistence&#8212;all
of which it was intended to imply by referring to the
"stress of dryness" which overtakes the little axolotl in his contented
existence as a tadpole.</p>
<p class="add2em">When we examine into the conditions
under which a body starts to move
and the conditions under which a body once started is kept in
motion, we come across a very remarkable fact, if we are
careful to consider every force which acts upon the body, and this
remarkable fact is that the forces which act upon <i>a body at
rest</i> are related to each other in precisely the same way as
the forces which act upon <i>a body moving steadily along a
straight path</i>. Therefore it is convenient to consider,
<i>first</i> the relation between the forces which act upon
a body at rest,
or upon a body in uniform motion, and <i>second</i> the
relation
between the forces which act upon a body which is starting
or stopping or changing the direction of its motion. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg_43]</a></span>
</p>
<p class="add2em">Suppose a person <i>A</i>
were to hold a box in
mid-air. To do so it would of course be necessary for him to push
upwards on the box so as to balance the downward pull of the earth, the
weight of the box as it is called. If another person <i>B</i>
were to take hold of
the box and pull upon it in any direction, <i>A</i> would
have to exert an equal pull on the box in the opposite direction to
keep it stationary. <i>The forces which act upon a stationary
body are always balanced.</i></p>
<p class="add2em">Every one, perhaps, realizes
that what is here said about the
balanced relation of the forces which act upon a stationary box, is
equally true of the forces which act on a box similarly
held in a steadily moving railway car or boat. Therefore, <i>the
forces which act upon a body which moves steadily
along a straight path are balanced</i>.</p>
<p class="add2em">This is evidently true when the moving
body is surrounded on all sides
by things which are moving along with it, as in a car or a
boat; but how about a body which moves steadily along a
straight path but which is surrounded by bodies which do not move
along with it? Everyone knows that some active agent such as a
horse or a steam engine must pull steadily upon such a body to
keep it in motion. If left to itself such a moving body
quickly comes to rest. Many have, no doubt, reached this further
inference from experience, namely, that the tendency of moving
bodies to come to rest is due to the dragging forces,
or friction, with which surrounding bodies act upon a body in
motion. Thus a moving boat is brought to rest by the drag of
the water when the propelling force ceases to act; a train of
cars is brought to rest because of the drag due to friction
when the pull of the locomotive ceases; a box which is moving
across a table comes to rest when left to itself, because
of the drag due to friction between the box and the table. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg_44]</a></span>
</p>
<p class="add2em">We must, therefore, always consider two
distinct forces when we are
concerned with a body which is kept in motion, namely, the
<i>propelling force</i> due to some active agent such as a
horse
or an engine, and the <i>dragging force</i> due to
surrounding bodies. Newton pointed out that when a body is moving
steadily along a straight path, the propelling force is always
equal and opposite to the dragging force. Therefore,
<i>The forces which act upon a body which is stationary,
or which is moving uniformly along a straight path, are balanced
forces</i>.</p>
<p class="add2em">Many hesitate to accept as a fact the
complete and exact balance
of propelling and dragging forces on a body which is moving
steadily along a straight path in the open, but direct
experiment shows it to be true, and the most elaborate
calculations and inferences based upon this idea of
the complete balance of propelling and dragging forces on a body in
uniform motion are verified by experiment. One may ask, why a canal
boat, for example, should continue to move if the pull of the
mule does not exceed the drag of the water; but why
should it stop if the drag does not exceed the pull?
Understand that we are not considering the starting
of the boat. The fact is that the conscious effort which one must exert
to
drive a mule, the cost of the mule, and the expense of his
keep, are what most people think of, however hard one tries to
direct their attention solely to the state of tension in the
rope that hitches the mule to the boat after the boat is
in full motion; and most people consider that if the function
of the mule is simply to balance the drag of the water so
as to keep the boat from stopping, then why should there not
be some way to avoid the cost of so insignificant an
operation? There is, indeed, an extremely important matter involved
here, but it has no bearing on the question as to the balance
of propulsion and drag on a body which moves steadily along a
straight path. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg_45]</a></span>
</p>
<p class="add2em">Let us now consider the relation between
the forces which act upon a
body which is changing its speed, upon a body which is being
started or stopped, for example. Everyone has noticed how a
mule strains at his rope when starting a canal boat,
especially if the boat is heavily loaded, and how the
boat continues to move for a long time after the mule ceases to pull.
In
the first case, the pull of the mule greatly exceeds the drag
of the water, and the speed of the boat increases; in the
second case, the drag of the water of course exceeds the pull of
the mule, for the mule is not pulling at all, and the speed
of the boat decreases. When the speed of a body is changing,
the forces which act on the body are unbalanced. We may
conclude therefore that <i>the effect of an unbalanced
force acting on a body is to change the velocity of the body</i>,
and it is evident that the longer the unbalanced force continues to act
the greater the change of velocity. Thus if the mule ceases to
pull on a canal boat for one second the velocity of the boat
will be but slightly reduced by the unbalanced drag of the
water, whereas if the mule ceases to pull for two seconds
the decrease of velocity will be much greater. <i>In fact the
change of velocity due to a given unbalanced force is
proportional to the time that the force continues to act.</i>
This is
exemplified by a body falling under the action of the unbalanced pull
of the earth; after one second it
will have gained a certain amount of velocity (about 32 feet per
second), after two
seconds it will have made a total gain of twice as much
velocity (about 64 feet per second), and so on. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg_46]</a></span>
</p>
<p class="add2em">Since the velocity produced by an
unbalanced force is proportional to the time that the force continues
to act, it is evident that the effect of the force should be specified
as so-much-velocity-produced-per-second, exactly as in the case of
earning money, the amount one earns is proportional to the
length of time that one continues to work, and we always
specify one's earning capacity as so-much-money-earned-per-day.</p>
<p class="add2em">Everyone knows what it
means to give an easy pull or a hard pull on a
body. That is to say, we all have the ideas of greater
and less as applied to forces. Everybody knows also that if a
mule pulls hard on a canal boat, the boat will get under way
more quickly than if the pull is easy, that is, the boat will
gain more velocity per unit of time under the action of
a hard pull than under the action of an easy pull.
Therefore, any precise statement of the effect of an unbalanced force
on a given body must correlate the
precise value of the force and the exact amount of velocity produced
per unit
of time by the force. This seems a very difficult thing,
but its apparent difficulty is very largely due to the fact
that we have not as yet agreed as to what we are to understand by the
statement that one force is
precisely three, or four,
or any number of times as great as another. Suppose, therefore, that <i>we
agree to call one force twice as
large as another when it will produce in a given
body twice as much
velocity in a given time</i> (remembering of course that
we are now talking about unbalanced forces, or that we are assuming for
the sake of simplicity of statement, that no dragging forces exist).
As a result of this definition we may state that <i>the amount
of velocity produced per second in a given body by an unbalanced force
is proportional to the force</i>. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg_47]</a></span>
</p>
<p>Of course we know no more about the matter
in hand than we did before we adopted
the definition, but we do have a good illustration of how important
a part is played in the study of physical science, by what we may
call making-up one's mind, in the sense of putting one's mind in
order. This kind of thing is very prominent in the study of elementary
physics, and the rather indefinite reference (in the story of the
little tasseled tadpole) to an inward growth as needful before one
can hope for any measure of success in our modern world of scientific
industry was an allusion to this thing, the "making-up" of one's
mind. Nothing is so essential in the acquirement of exact and solid
knowledge as the possession of precise ideas, not indeed that a perfect
precision is necessary as a means for retaining knowledge, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg_48]</a></span>
<i>but
that nothing else so effectually opens the mind for the perception
even of the simplest evidences of a subject</i>
<a id="FNanchor_7" name="FNanchor_7"></a><a class="fnanchor" href="#footnote_7">[7]</a>.
</p>
<p class="add2em">We have now settled the question as to
the effect of different unbalanced forces on a given body on the basis
of
very general experience, and by an agreement as
to the precise meaning to be
attached to the statement that one force is so many times as great
as another; but how about the effect of the same force
upon different bodies, and how may we identify the force so as to
be sure that it is the same? It is required, for example,
to exert a given force on body <i>A</i> and
then exert the same force on another body <i>B</i>. This
can be
done by causing a third body <i>C</i> (a coiled spring,
for
example) to exert the force; then the forces exerted on <i>A</i>
and
<i>B</i> are the same if the
reaction in each case produces the same effect on body <i>C</i>
(the same degree of stretch, for example). Concerning the effects
of the same unbalanced force on different bodies three things
have to be settled by experiment as follows:</p>
<p class="add2em"><span class="add2em">(a)</span>
In the first place let us suppose that a certain force <b><i>F</i></b>
is twice as large as a certain
other force <b><i>G</i></b>, according to our
agreement, because the force <b><i>F</i></b>
produces twice as much velocity
every second as force <b>G</b> when the one and then the
other of these forces is caused to act upon a given body, a piece of
lead for example. Then, does the force <b><i>F</i></b>
produce twice as
much velocity every second as the force <b><i>G</i></b>
whatever the
nature and size of the given body, whether it be wood, or ice, or
sugar? Experiment shows that it does. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg_49]</a></span>
</p>
<p class="add2em"><span class="add2em">(b)</span>
In
the second place, suppose that we have such amounts of lead,
or iron, or wood, etc., that a certain given force produces
the same amount of velocity per second when it is made to
act, as an unbalanced force, upon one or another of these
various bodies. Then what is the relation between the amounts
of these various substances? Experiment shows that they all
have the same mass in grams, or pounds, as determined by a
balance. That is, a given force produces the same amount of
velocity per second in a given number of grams of any kind of
substance. Thus the earth pulls with a certain definite force (in
a given locality) upon <b><i>M</i></b> grams
of any substance and,
aside from the dragging forces due to air friction, all kinds of
bodies gain the same amount of velocity per second when they
fall under action of the unbalanced pull of the earth.</p>
<p class="add2em"><span class="add2em">(c)</span>
In the third place, what is the relation between the velocity
per second produced by a given force and the mass in grams (or
pounds) of the body upon which it acts. Experiment shows
that <i>the velocity per second produced by a given force is
inversely proportional to the mass of the body upon which the force
acts</i>. In speaking of the mass of the body in grams (or
pounds) we here refer to the result which is obtained by weighing
the body on a balance scale, and the experimental fact
which is here referred to constitutes a very important discovery:
namely, when one body
has twice the mass of another,
according to the balance method of measuring mass, it is
accelerated half as fast by a given unbalanced force. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg_50]</a></span>
</p>
<p class="add2em">The effect of an unbalanced force in
producing velocity may therefore be summed up as follows: <i>The
velocity per second produced by an unbalanced force is proportional to
the force and
inversely proportional to the mass of the body upon which the force
acts, and the velocity produced by an unbalanced force is
always in the direction of the force.</i></p>
<hr />
<p class="p2">"We advise all men," says Bacon, "to think
of the true ends of knowledge,
and that they endeavor not after it for curiosity, contention,
or the sake of despising others, nor yet for reputation or power
or any other such inferior consideration, but solely for the
occasions and uses of life." It is difficult to imagine any other basis
upon
which the study of physics can be justified than for the occasions
and uses of life; in a certain broad sense, indeed, there is no
other justification. But the great majority of men must needs be
practical
in the narrow sense, and physics, as the great majority of men
study it, relates chiefly to the conditions which have been elaborated
through the devices of industry as exemplified in our mills and
factories, in our machinery of transportation, in optical and musical
instruments, in the means for the supply <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg_51]</a></span>
of power, heat, light, and
water for general and domestic use, and so on.</p>
<p>From this narrow practical point of view it may seem that
there can be nothing
very exacting in the study of the physical sciences; but what is
physics? That is the question. One definition at least is to be
repudiated; it is not "The science of masses, molecules and the ether."
Bodies have mass and railways have length, and to speak of physics
as the <i>science of masses</i> is as silly as to define
railroading
as the <i>practice of lengths</i>, and nothing as
reasonable as this can
be said in favor of the conception of physics as the science of
molecules and the ether; it is the sickliest possible notion of
physics,
whereas the healthiest notion, even if a student does not wholly
grasp it, is that physics is the science of the ways of taking hold of
things and pushing them!</p>
<p> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg_52]</a></span>
Bacon long ago listed in his quaint way the things which
seemed to him most
needful for the advancement of learning. Among other things he
mentioned "A New Engine or a Help to the mind corresponding to Tools
for
the hand," and the most remarkable aspect of present-day physical
science is that aspect in which it constitutes a realization of this
New Engine of Bacon. We
continually force upon the extremely meager
data obtained directly through our senses, an interpretation which, in
its complexity and penetration, would seem to be entirely
incommensurate
with the data themselves, and we exercise over physical things a
kind of rational control which greatly transcends the native cunning of
the hand. The possibility of this forced interpretation and of this
rational control depends upon the use of two complexes: (a) A
<i>logical structure</i>, that is to say, a body of
mathematical and conceptual
theory which is brought to bear upon the immediate materials of sense,
and (b) a <i>mechanical structure</i>, that is to say,
either (1) a
carefully planned <i>arrangement of apparatus</i>, such as
is always necessary
in making physical measurements, or (2) a carefully planned <i>order
of operations</i>, such as the successive operations of solution,
reaction,
precipitation, filtration, and weighing in chemistry.</p>
<p>These two complexes do indeed constitute a New Engine which
helps the mind
as tools help the hand; it is through the enrichment of the
materials of sense by the operation of this New Engine that the
elaborate
interpretations of the physical sciences are made possible, and the
study of elementary physics is intended to lead <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg_53]</a></span>
to the
realization
of this New Engine: (a) By the building up in the mind, of the
logical structure of the physical sciences; (b) by training in the
making of measurements and in the performance of ordered operations,
and (c) by exercises in the application of these things to the
actual phenomena of physics and chemistry at every step and all of
the time with every possible variation.</p>
<p>That, surely, is a sufficiently exacting program; and the only
alternative
is to place the student under the instruction of Jules Verne
where he need not trouble himself about foundations but may follow his
teacher pleasantly on a care-free trip to the moon or with easy
improvidence embark on a voyage of twenty-thousand leagues under the
sea.</p>
<p>What it means to study physical science may be explained
further by mentioning
the chief difficulties encountered in the teaching of that
subject. One difficulty is that the native sense of most men is
woefully
inadequate without stimulation and direction for supplying the sense
material upon which the logical structure of the science is intended
to operate. A second difficulty is that the human mind is so in the
habit of considering the practical affairs of life <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg_54]</a>
</span> that it can hardly be
turned to that minute consideration of apparently insignificant
details which is so necessary in the scientific analysis even of
the most practical things. Everyone knows the capacity of the Indian
for
long continued and serious effort in his primitive mode of life, and
yet it is difficult to persuade an Indian "farmer" to plow. Everyone
knows also that the typical college student is not stupid, and yet it
is difficult to persuade the young men of practical and business
ideals in our colleges and technical schools to study the abstract
elements of science. Indeed it is as difficult to get the average
young man to hold abstract things in mind as to get a young Indian to
plow, and for almost exactly the same reason. The scientific details of
any problem are in themselves devoid of human value, and this
quality of detachment is the most serious obstacle to young people in
their study of the sciences.</p>
<p>A third difficulty which indeed runs through the entire
front-of-progress
of the human understanding is that the primitive mind-stuff
of a young man must be rehabilitated in entirely new relations
in fitting the young man for the conditions of modern life. Every
science teacher knows how much coercion is required for so little <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg_55]</a></span>
of
this rehabilitation; but the bare possibility of the process is a
remarkable fact, and that it is possible to the extent of bringing a
Newton
or a Pasteur out of a hunting and fishing ancestry is indeed wonderful.
Everyone is familiar with the life history of a butterfly, how it
lives first as a caterpillar and then undergoes a complete
transformation
into a winged insect. It is, of course, evident that the bodily
organs of a caterpillar are not at all suited to the needs of a
butterfly, the very food (of those species which take food) being
entirely
different. As a matter of fact almost every portion of the bodily
structure of the caterpillar is dissolved as it were, into a formless
pulp at the beginning of the transformation, and the organization
of a flying insect then grows out from a central nucleus very much
as a chicken grows in the food-stuff of an egg. So it is in the
development of a young man. In early childhood the individual, if he
has
been favored by fortune, exercises and develops more or less
extensively
the primitive instincts and modes of the race in a free outdoor
life, and the result is so much mind-stuff to be dissolved and
transformed with more or less coercion and under more or less
constraint
into an effective mind of the twentieth-century type. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg_56]</a></span>
</p>
<p>A fourth difficulty is that the possibility of the
rehabilitation of mind-stuff
has grown up as a human faculty almost solely on the basis of
language, and the essence of this rehabilitation lies in the formation
of ideas; whereas <i>a very large part of physical
science is a correlation in mechanisms</i>.</p>
<p>The best way of meeting this quadruply difficult situation in
the teaching
of elementary physics is to relate the teaching as much as possible
to the immediately practical and intimate things of life, and to go
in for suggestiveness as the only way to avoid a total inhibition
of the sense that is born with a young man. Such a method is
certainly calculated to limber up our theories and put them all at
work, the
pragmatic method, our friends the philosophers call it, a method
which pretends to a conquering destiny.</p>

<p>The first object of all work&#8212;not the principal one, but the

<p>But it is quite possible to have too much of all these things.
I know a
great many gentlemen, who eat too large dinners; a great many ladies,
who have too many clothes. I know there is lodging to spare in London,
for I have several houses there myself, which I can't let. And I know

<p class="p2">Two generations ago school was supplemented
by endless opportunity for play,
and children had to work about the house and farm more and more as
they grew to maturity. Play and work were in those days as plentiful
as sunshine and air, and it is no wonder that educational ideals
were developed taking no account of them. But we cling to these old
ideals
at the present time when children have no opportunity to play, when
there is an almost complete absence of old fashioned chores about the
home, when boys never see their fathers at work, and when the only
opportunity for boys and girls to work outside the home is to face
the certainty of reckless exploitation! What a piece of stupidity!
Our entire educational system, primary and secondary, collegiate
and technical, is sick with inconsequential bookishness, and school
work has become the most inefficient of all the organized efforts of
men.</p>
<p>Yes but we have our Manual Training Schools and our college

Work and Shop Inspection. Away with such scholastic shams! The

<p class="p2">Late in the evening we took the train for
Loveland from which place we were to
start on a walking trip to Laramie, up in Wyoming.</p>
<p>In Loveland we purchased a pony and a pack-saddle. The pony
had never been
broken to the saddle, and inasmuch as the art of packing has always to
be learned anew when one has not practiced it for several years,
both of us were, in some respects, as green as the pony, and naturally
somewhat nervous when we started from Loveland. The pony served us
well however and at the worst only gave us a name for the Bucking
Horse Pass when we crossed the range of the Medicine Bow Mountains
from the waters of the Grand River to those of the North Platte.</p>
<p>From Loveland we reached Sprague's Ranch in Estes Park,
thirty-five miles
away, in two days of easy travel over a good stage road, encountering
a snow squall in the high foothills which left us cold and wet at
sundown of the first day. In Estes Park we stayed three days,
fishing, running up to timber line as preliminary exercise, and writing
letters. The writer had spent two previous summers in Estes Park near
Sprague's Ranch in company with friends from the University of Kansas. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg_67]</a></span>

<p style="text-align: right;">June 21st.</p>
<p><i>My dear little Friend</i>:&#8212;</p>
<p>D. and I reached this place day before yesterday. I saw Fred
Sprague yesterday.
He had already learned of our presence in the Park, having seen our
characteristic hob-nail tracks, and, as his mother tells me, he
remarked upon seeing them that "God's people had come," meaning the
Kansas
boys with whom he became acquainted in '86 and '89.</p>
<p>We have passed thousands of flowers since leaving Loveland,
white poppies,
cactus, blue bells, columbine and others more than I can tell. The
blue bells are of the same kind that you and I found near Bloomington
several weeks ago. It would be very nice if you and I could make
some of our Saturday excursions in this country.</p>
<p>I wish I could tell you more of our trip. Of course it is
scarcely begun as
yet, but I know pretty well what it will be; hard, for one thing, and
lonesome, but strangely fascinating. We are beginning already to
have that attitude towards nature which I imagine Indians have,
namely, the desire to get something to eat out of everything we see.
[M.
had written her brother D. at Moraine post office of the pies and cakes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg_68]</a></span>
they were making at home.] This is by no means greediness, for a
measured appetite is essentially incompatible with the conditions of
Indian
life. In fact the only wild animals which are not gourmands on
occasion are those which eat grass. Of course, we are at best only
Agency
Indians, but we shall soon be off our reservation.</p>
<p>Few people realize the utter desolation of many parts of the
Rocky Mountains; and often on my mountain trips, hungry and foot-sore,
my fancy has
turned to what my friend 'Gric<a id="FNanchor_8" name="FNanchor_8"></a>
<a class="fnanchor" href="#footnote_8">[8]</a>
has told me of the utterly desolate
Funeral Mountains that border Death Valley in southern California,
and of the infinite sunshine there. What would <i>you</i>
think, my
little friend, even now amid the comforts and joys of home, if you
could hear a trustworthy account of an actual trip over those dreadful
Mountains and into that awful Valley?</p>
<p>I hope that the map with the accompanying description will
help you to a
knowledge of the geography and geology of this country. I send kind
regards to
your father and mother.</p>

<p class="p2">Starting from Estes Park for the Grand River
country we stopped over night at <i>Camp Desolation</i> in
Windy Gulch, an
enormous amphitheater rising
above timber line on the north, east, and west, and opening to the
south
into Big Thompson Canyon. The mouth of the Gulch is dammed by the
lateral moraine of an ancient Thompson glacier and behind this dam is a
level, marshy stretch with a few green spruce and thickets of aspen,
black alder and mountain willow. Near timber line also is a
scattered fringe of green with dots of white. All the rest is a
desolate
stretch of burned timber.</p>
<p>Trailing to the head of Windy Gulch in the morning we gained
the summit of
Thompson Ridge which we followed in a northwesterly direction
for about twelve miles; then we circled around the head of Big
Thompson river and went down to Camp at the head of the Cache la Poudre
river, precisely on the Continental Divide in Milner Pass about two
hundred feet below timber line with Specimen Mountain immediately to
the north of us.</p>

<p class="p2 smcap" style="text-align: right;">Specimen
Mountain Camp</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">June 24th.</p>
<p><i>My Dear B</i>:&#8212;</p>
<p>D. and I are going to run down to Grand Lake settlement
to-morrow for bacon and
flour so I write this today. I have been in camp all morning cooking
and mending while D. has been looking for sheep up in the crater of
Specimen Mountain. He saw two and shot without effect. Specimen
Mountain is an extinct volcano and sheep come to the crater to lick. I
have seen as many as a hundred and fifty sheep there at different
times during the four trips that I have made to this region, but I have
hunted them only one day (the first) of the twenty-five that I
have spent in this camp&#8212;without success, of course.</p>
<p>Flowers in profusion are found at these altitudes already
where the shrinking
snow drifts have exposed the ground to the warm June sun, but under
the drifts it is yet the dead of winter. As the season advances
the snow recedes, and each newly uncovered strip of ground passes
with exuberant haste through a cycle of spring.</p>
<p>We came over from Estes Park yesterday and the day before. At
one point I
carried the horse's pack about a quarter of a mile on account of
steepness of trail and depth of snow, leaving the pony under D.'s
guidance
to wallow through <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg_71]</a>
</span> as best she
could. We shall, no doubt, have some hard
work getting out of the Grand River valley to the north over the
Medicine Bow but we intend to keep at it. We are, of course, likely to
get
cold and wet, tired and hungry. In fact, I am neither very dry nor very
warm now as I write, for it is half snowing and half raining; nor
hungry
(?) for I have just eaten three slices of bacon, half a corn cake eight
inches in diameter and an inch thick, with bacon gravy made with flour
and water, and nearly a quart of strong coffee of syrupy sweetness.
I do wish D. had killed that sheep this morning! We hope to get some
trout to-morrow out of Grand River, but to see the sheets of water
which are being shed off the range from rain and melting snow makes one
feel uncertain of the trout fishing. I will close for this time and
put this into my knapsack. To-morrow D. and I will get our "walkins"
on bright and early, and pack it to Grand Lake. This is a tough
country beyond imagination.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg_72]</a>
</span></p>
<p class="p2">When trailing above timber line on our way
to Specimen Mountain and subsequently
we were on snow much of the time; below timber line at high
altitudes we contended about equally with snow and fallen timber; and
at
middle altitudes where the timber is heavy and where fires have been
frequent and disastrous the fallen timber alone is quite enough to make
travel troublesome. Mud and water, fallen and falling, we
encountered everywhere, but without much concern. The greatest vexation
to the amateur traveler in the Rockies is to slip off a log in trying
to cross a stream, and thus get wet all over, when if one had been
reasonable, one might have been wet only to the middle. An awkward
comrade of '89 did this so many times that it became a standing
joke; but 'Gric,
as we called him, that is to say <i>Agricola</i>,
after his father "Farmer" Funston of Kansas, developed grit enough to
take him through Death Valley in southern California, to take him, all
alone, 1,600 miles down the Yukon River in an open boat and across 200
miles of unexplored country during the winter night to the shores of
the Arctic Ocean, to take him into the Cuban army, where he received
three serious wounds, and finally to take him through the Philippines <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg_73]</a>
</span> with our Volunteer Army where he captured Aguinaldo.</p>
<p>From <i>Specimen Mountain Camp</i> in Milner
Pass we made our way to Grand River over
an extremely difficult trail, nearly breaking our pony's leg in the
fallen timber, and, finding it impossible to reach Grand Lake by
the river trail without wetting our pack, we went into (<i>Mosquito</i>)
camp and did our week's washing. The next day we left our pony, and
made a flying round trip of thirty miles to the settlement. The next
morning, hoping to escape the mosquitoes, we moved campseveral
miles up stream and in the afternoon we climbed to the summit of one of
the high spurs of a nameless<a id="FNanchor_9" name="FNanchor_9"></a>
<a class="fnanchor" href="#footnote_9">[9]</a>
peak in the range of the Medicine
Bow. We got back to camp late in the evening in a sharp rain, which
continued all night.</p>
<p>The next morning promised fair weather, and after some
hesitation, we packed up
for the trip over to North Park. Starting at eight o'clock we reached
the deserted mining camp, Lulu, at eleven, having forded Grand
River seven times, <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg_74]</a>
</span> the water of it ice cold and swift as an arrow. We then
began to climb the range, the summit of which we reached at three
o'clock at the pass of the Bucking Horse far above timber line. At four
o'clock we began the descent into the valley of the Michigan fork of
the
North Platte. The rain, until now fitful, became steady and we,
determined
to reach a good camping place, kept our pony at a half-trot until
eight o'clock, when we found a deserted cabin. We were too impatiently
hungry to make biscuit, which we ordinarily baked in the frying pan
before cooking our bacon, so we made our supper of graham mush, bacon,
bacon gravy and coffee. Next morning we found to our dismay that our
baking
powder had been left at the Bucking Horse&#8212;and no wonder, for our pack
had been strewn for a quarter of a mile along the trail&#8212;so we were
reduced to mush again for breakfast.</p>

<p><i>My Dear B</i>:&#8212;</p>
<p>We have just returned from a week's hunt in the Medicine Bow
Mountains east of
here. We saw elk, killed a deer, and spent the Fourth of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg_75]</a>
</span> July on a prominent but nameless peak from which we got a
splendid view.</p>

<p>After breakfast at Camp <i>Mush</i>,
Mr.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;Gould, a neighboring cattle
rancher
who has no cattle, was attracted by the smoke of our campfire, and
coming
up to see us, he invited us to his shanty to eat venison. We went.
We have now been with him a week and we are starting on our second
carcass.</p>
<p>Gould lives by hunting and trapping, and by odd work in the
Park during the
haying season. He came to this country years ago with a hunting
party and has been hunting ever since. Several years ago he took up
a claim in the extreme southeastern corner of North Park conveniently
near to hunting grounds in the Medicine Bow. He gave up his
claim, for good, a year ago, and made an overland trip to New Mexico.
That did not satisfy him either, so now he is back in his old shanty
again. He thinks we are the toughest "tender-foots" he ever saw. He
approves of us, there is no doubt about that, and he has pulled up
his stakes to travel with us just for the pleasure of our company!
He takes great interest in D.'s knowledge of bugs, and D. and he are
both real hunters each <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg_76]</a>
</span> according to his experience. Before we fell in
with Gould I could persuade D. to wanton exertion in the way of
mountain climbing but now I am in the minority, but the hunters
propose,
with a flourish, the scaling of every peak that comes in sight.</p>
<p>I had a spell of mountain fever just before the Fourth and
Gould dosed me with
sage brush tea, the vilest concoction I ever had to take.</p>
<p>Gould is not accustomed to walk except when actually hunting,
so he has a
riding horse, and a trusty old pack animal whose minimum name is "G&#8212;&#8212;
d&#8212;&#8212; you Jack," and whose maximum name (and load) is indeterminate.
Gould is going with us to spend a week in the Range of the
Rabbit's Ear, far to the west across North Park. He has an old wagon
which, if it holds together, will save D. and me some tedious steps
across the desert, for indeed this "park" is a desert. We shall pass
through Walden, the metropolis and supply station of the Park.</p>
<p class="add5em">Yours, <span class="add5em">F.</span>
</p>
<p class="p4 smcap">From D.'s Mother</p>

that we do not hear from you and I shall try not to be disappointed
if we do not hear for a while. Nevertheless my dear boy, the
uncertainty I feel in regard to your safety will make a letter very
welcome indeed. Perhaps I would have more courage if I were strong.
For five days I have been very uncomfortable. I am sitting up some

and

<p class="p2">At Walden we laid in a fresh supply of flour
and bacon, and canned goods,
especially canned fruit, to last us while we stayed with the wagon. We
then pushed on to the west, striking camp on the West Fork of the
North Platte, where we stayed two nights. Here we tried hard a third
time
for trout without success, but we turned off the water from an
irrigating ditch and captured a large number of "squaw fish" (suckers).</p>
<p>From <i>Camp Chew</i> we made our way well up
into the foothills of the Range of
the Rabbit's Ear, and then packed our animals, minimum Jack and our
pony, and pushed up the range over the worst trail we had yet
encountered,
through an absolute wilderness of fallen timber. Rain with fog
set in as we approached timber line, and we were forced to go into camp
early to wait for morning. Morning came with fog and rain, and we
spent the entire day hunting trail, only to go into camp again towards
evening. The next day, however, came clear and we made our way over the
range, through Frying Pan Meadow, and reached camp down on Elk river
towards evening without difficulty. We found good fishing here at
last and great numbers of deer but no elk. After three rainy days in
<i>Elk River Camp</i>, one of which was spent jerking
venison of D.'s
killing, we packed up and made the return trip over the range in one
day of
hard travel, going into camp by the shore of a shallow pond well
out on the barren level of North Park. The next morning we parted

intended walking through to Laramie, but ninety miles and two mountain
ranges in three days, not to mention the writer's terribly blistered
feet, had temporarily taken some of the ambition out of us, and after
some fine diplomacy D. and the writer each found that the other was
willing to descend to stage coach riding. We accordingly sold our
fine little pony for five dollars, packed our outfit in a compact
bundle which we wrapped in our small tent (which had been used as a
smoke-house for curing venison at <i>Elk River Camp</i>),
and took the stage for
Laramie.</p>
<p>At Laramie we took the train for home, and with eyes eagerly
awake we watched
for hundreds of miles an increasing luxuriance of vegetation which
reached its climax in the marvelously rich, endless, undulating fields
of eastern Nebraska and Iowa:</p>

<p class="p2">We had
been away from home for thirty-three days, and in the mountains for
thirty-one nights&#8212;Indians reckon by nights; and we had tramped more
than
three hundred and fifty miles from Loveland to the edge of the
Laramie plains. A large portion of the time was spent at high altitudes
where the weather is not lamb-like in June, and no small portion of
the three hundred and fifty miles was mud and water, snow and fallen
timber, through a country as rough, perhaps, as is to be found
anywhere, and as interesting. The only way to study Geography is with
the feet! No footless imagination can realize the sublimity&lt; of
western
Mountain and Plain. Nothing but a degree of hardship can measure
their widespread chaos and lonely desolation, and only the freshened
eagerness of many mornings can perceive their matchless glory. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg_83]</a>

see, the other day, the 83rd
number of the <i>Graphic</i>, with the picture of the
Queen's concert in it? All
the fine ladies sitting so trimly, and looking so sweet, and doing
the whole duty of woman&#8212;wearing their fine clothes gracefully;
and the pretty singer, white-throated, warbling "Home sweet
home" to them, so morally, and melodiously! Here was yet to be our
ideal

are safe back
with our virtues in satin slippers and lace veils&#8212;and our Kingdom of
Heaven is come <i>with</i> observation!</p>

<p class="p2">Ruskin has said that the children of the
rich often get the worst education
to be had for money, whereas the children of the poor often get the
best education for nothing. And the poor man's school is hardship.</p>
<p>It is generally admitted that wealthy American parents are too
indulgent
towards their children. However this may be, many an American
father is determined that his sons shall not go through what he himself
went through as a boy, forgetting that the hardships of his youth were
largely the hardships of pioneer life which have vanished forever.
No boy with good stuff in him and with a fair education unmixed
with extravagant habits of living can possibly have more hardship
nowadays than is good for him. Every young man must sooner or later
stand by himself; and hardship, which in its essence is to be thrown on
one's own resources, is the best school.</p>
<p>But the most alluring school of hardship, a sort of Summer
School of the
University of Hard Knocks, is a walking trip into the mountains to the
regions of summer snow, carrying one's whole outfit on one's back as
did the
Kansas <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg_92]</a>
</span> boys of '89, or indulging in the ownership of a pack-pony
and a miner's tent as did D. and the writer in '95. The hardships
of such a trip are of the old old type, the facing of all kinds of
weather and the hunting for food, and they waken a thousand-fold deeper
response than the most serious hunt for a job in a modern city.</p>

<p><i>My Friends</i>:</p>
<p>It cannot but be pleasing to us to reflect, this day, that if
we are&lt; often
foolish enough to talk English without understanding it, we are often
wise
enough to talk Latin without knowing it. For this month retains
its pretty Roman name, which means the month of Opening; of the light
in the days, and the life in the leaves, and of the voices of birds,
and of the hearts of men.</p>
<p>And being the month of Manifestation, it is pre-eminently the
month of
Fools;&#8212;for under the beatific influence of moral sunshine, or
Education,
the Fools always come out first.</p>
<p>But what is less pleasing to reflect upon, this spring
morning, is, that there
are some kinds of education which may be described, not as moral
sunshine, but as moral moonshine; and that, under these, Fools come out
both First&#8212;and Last.</p>
<p>We have, it seems, now set our opening hearts much on this one
point, that we
will have education for all men and women now, and for all girls and
boys that are to be. Nothing, indeed, can be more desirable, if only we
determine also what kind of education we are to have. It is taken for
granted that any education must be good;&#8212;that the more of it we get,
the better; that bad education only means little education; and that
the worst we have to fear is getting none. Alas that is not at all so.
Getting no education is by no means the worst thing that can happen
to us. The real thing to be feared is getting a bad one.</p>

<p class="p2">The recent exchange of visits between
Pennsylvanians and Wisconsinites has
resulted in the organization of an association for the carrying out of
the
Wisconsin Idea in Pennsylvania; but the New York <i>Evening Post</i>,
in commenting upon the Pennsylvania version of the Wisconsin Idea,
calls attention to the fact that in Wisconsin the idea is carried
into effect by public agencies, whereas the Pennsylvania version is
to be executed privately! The <i>Evening Post</i> did not,
indeed,
say execute; I, myself, have introduced the word, because it so exactly
conveys the meaning of the <i>Post's</i> criticism.</p>
<p>Why is it that so many good people take up things like the Boy
Scout movement,
privately, never giving a moment's thought to our rusting school
machinery? Why are we so privately minded as to enthuse over Mrs.
so-and-so's out-of-the-city movement for children, never thinking of
the
<i>potentialities</i> of establishments like Girard
College? The trouble is
that we Americans have never learned to do things together; we still
have the loyal but lazy habit of looking expectantly for a King, and,
of course, we get a Philadelphia Ring, the lowest Circle in the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg_96]</a></span>
Inferno of the
Worst; and all the while our might be doers of good affect a
kind of private Kingship, and sink into a mire of idiotic<a id="FNanchor_11" name="FNanchor_11"></a>
<a class="fnanchor" href="#footnote_11">[11]</a>
impotence.</p>
<p>The seven wonders of the world all fade into insignificance in
comparison
with one great fact in modern government, a fact so fundamental
that we seldom think of it, namely, the great fact of taxation.
Funds sufficient to meet every public need of the community flow
automatically into the public treasury. This is indeed a very
remarkable
thing, but it seems almost ludicrous when we consider that wasteful
expenditure of public funds is the universal rule, and that good
people everywhere are struggling to do public things privately! Was
there
ever before two such horns to a dilemma? Fog horns, grown inwardly
on every Pennsylvanian's head! When a city of 10,000 people has an
annual school budget of $60,000, it is evident that everything can be
done that needs to be done for the schooling of children.</p>
<p>I believe that the school day should be increased to 8 hours,
the school
week to 6 days, and the school year to 12 months; with elastic <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg_97]</a></span>
provision
for home work and out-of-town visiting. I believe that school
activities should include a wide variety of simple hand work, and a
great deal of outdoor play, with ample provision for the things that
are
done by Boy Scouts and Camp Fire Girls; and when children are old
enough
and strong enough to begin their vocational training, their school
activities should be combined with work in office and factory. Let no
one
imagine that such a program is impracticable; for in the city,
school is the sum of all influences outside the home, and the school
day
is now more than eight hours, the school week is more than six
days, and school lasts the whole year through; these are the facts, say
what you will; and everything is in a dreadful state of
confusion&#8212;excepting
only book work. <i>It is time for us to think of the
public school as including everything which makes for the efficient
organization and orderly control of the juvenile world</i>. The
Junior
Municipality, which has been recently proposed, added to existing
school work with provision for simple manual training and outdoor
play would constitute a fairly complete realization of this wide
conception of the public school, and any narrower conception is
hopeless
in a modern city. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg_98]</a></span>
</p>
<p>As to educational values there is a widespread
misunderstanding. Imagine a
teacher taking his youngsters on a hike two or three times a week all
winter long! Every parent, <i>hoping for his children to escape
the
necessity of work</i>, would howl in stupid criticism "Is that
what I send my
children to school for?" Or the School Superintendent might have the
point of view of the excessively teachy teacher, who, in a recent
discussion of the Boy Scout idea, admitted that cross-country hikes
would be a good thing, provided, something were associated with them to
justify them, and this something was understood to be bookish! As to
vocational training, on the other hand, we must reckon with the
manufacturer
who will not train workmen for his competitors but who expects
his competitors to train workmen for him. And we must also reckon
with the ministerial member of the school-board who meets a proposal
for vocational training with the question "How then will you educate
for life?"</p>

The western prairies, except in the very center of the Mississippi
Valley, are beautifully rolling, and they meet every stream with
deeply carved bluffs. In the early days every stream was fringed with
woods; and prairie and woodland, alike, knew nothing beyond the evenly
balanced contest of indigenous life. There came, however, a succession
of strange epidemics, as one after another of our noxious weeds gained
foothold in that fertile land. I remember well several years when
dog-fennel grew in every nook and corner of my home town in Kansas;
then, after a few years, a variety of thistle grew to the exclusion of
every other uncultivated thing; and then followed a curious epidemic
of tumble-weed, a low spreading annual which broke off at the ground
in the Fall and was rolled across the open country in countless
millions by the Autumn winds. I remember well my first lone "beggar
louse," and how pretty I thought it was! And my first dandelion, and
of that I have never changed my opinion!</p>

Science
as young people study it has two chief aspects, or in other words, it
may be roughly divided into two parts, namely, the study of <i>the
things which come upon us,</i>, as it were, and the study
of <i>the things which we deliberately devise</i>.
The things that come
upon us include weather phenomena and every aspect and phase of the
natural world, the
things we cannot escape; and the things we devise relate chiefly to
the serious work of the world, the things we laboriously build and
the things we deliberately and patiently seek.</p>

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
